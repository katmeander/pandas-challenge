###Summary of the School Scores Analysis

In this exercise we combined two sets of data. The first was information about the schools - including the type of school (Charter or District), the number of students and the total budget. The second set of data included the students at each school, their grade, and their math and reading scores. In looking at this data, we can summarize it as follows:
* 15 Schools
* Total of 39,170 students
* A total budget of $24,649,428
* The average math score of all students is 78.98%
* The average reading score of all students is 81.88%
* 74.98% of all students had a passing math score (70% or higher)
* 85.81% of all students had a passing math score (70% or higher)
* Overall 65.17% of all students had both a passing reading and passing math score

Further analysis of the data looked at:
* Number of students per school
* School budget per student
* Percentage of students with a passing (70% or higher) math test score per school
* Percentage of students with a passing (70% or higher) reading test score per school
* Percentage of students with a combined passing (70% or higher) math and reading test score
* Top 5 schools with the highest overall combined math and reading passing test score
* Bottom 5 schools with the lowest 5 overall combined math and reading passing test score
* Breakdown of average math test scores by school and by grade
* Breakdown of average reading test scores by school and by grade
* Breadown by school budget per student:
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students with a passing math score
- Percentage of students with a passing reading score
- Percentage of students with both a passing math and reading score
* Breakout by school size:
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students with a passing math score
- Percentage of students with a passing reading score
- Percentage of students with both a passing math and reading score
* Breakout by school type - whether it was a District school or Charter school
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students with a passing math score
- Percentage of students with a passing reading score
- Percentage of students with both a passing math and reading score

In conclusions, the data shows, in regards to spending per student, that the higher the budget was per student the lower the overall passing test scores. Conversely, the lower the budget per student, the higher the overall passing test scores.
Also, Large schools (2000-5000 students), had lower scores across the board - average math scores, average reading scores, percentage of students passing math, reading and overall; when compared to small or medium schools.
Lastly, Charter schools had higher scores than District schools in all categories.
